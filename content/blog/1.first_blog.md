# Initiating this Blog
I can't believe in my ~8 years of web programming, I've never once have the need to set up and use any CI/CD stuff. This changes today (hopefully).

Before you start to yell bad things at me, please let me explain a few things first. 
Back in 2015, the year I started my journey in this 'career', I don't even use any version control system to manage my project. 
I only started learning and using Git back in 2017 when I work on a big project with many people in it.
Don't get me wrong, I do know the benefit of a version control system and I even tried using SVN back in the day.
The benefit of being able to go back a few iteration back to restore things that you broke (especially if you're careless like me) sounds like a godsend to me.
Alas, the hassle of setting up an SVN system for a simple personal project is such a big turn down.
In the end, I only fully realized and started using a versioning system (Git in my case) back in early 2019, pretty late huh?

Additionally, for the past few years, the place I work for pretty much centralized their work in an FTP server.
So, the way we work is pretty much remoting to an FTP server using Visual Studio Code's FTP plugin, and pretty much editing the files together, notifying each other whenever we're about to change a common file. Sounds terrible doesn't it? üòÖ

With CI/CD system being tightly coupled to a versioning system, and my coworkers and clients for the past few years not really using a versioning system, CI/CD system haven't been an option for me. 

Now, A few days after doing my thesis defense, I just got an idea out of the blue to make a blog like [stitcher.io](stitcher.io).
I just want to start writing stuff for fun even though probably no one will read it (If you read this, you're awesome! I really aprpreciate it üòò).
The biggest requirement for me is minimal if not zero hosting and domain fees. So, my option is pretty much limited to Github Pages.
Now, the hosting is pretty much decided, what tech stack should I use?

For the past 3 years or so, my work is usually done using Laravel, and while it's a great framework, it's not really the right tool for this particular task. 
The main reason is, GitHub Pages doesn't support PHP and only support static rendering. Now what option do I have then?
After scouring the internet for latest static site framework, the options are :
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
- And many more actually, you can check them [here](https://jamstack.org/generators/)

GitHub pretty much recommends Jekyll in their GitHub Pages website, so that's a big no for me personally, I want this to be a challenge üòÖ.
So, the remaining options are Astro, Next.js, and Nuxt. So how do I choose what to use then?
Most people would compare each other, finding the best one for their use case. Me? I just go with the one I like the name most, so I choose Nuxt ü§ê.

## Nuxt
So, what is Nuxt then? So Nuxt is, ehm... (Taken directly from their website)
> Nuxt is a free and open-source framework with an intuitive and extendable way to create type-safe, performant and production-grade full-stack web applications and websites with Vue.js.

Now, I'm not very familiar with Vue.js or Nuxt, so if you look at the [source code](https://github.com/praguzz/praguzz.github.io) of this website, you'll find a lot easy to spot mistakes and bad habits that I currently don't realize. 
Please do note that this blog is as much an educational experience for you and me as well. 
So, if you find one, please kindly leave an issue at the source page üòÖ.

## Starting Out The Nuxt Journey
So, I pretty much followed Nuxt's guides available on their website and got the initial page running. Hurray! üéâ

Next, I just started creating a simple layout using Tailwind.
![Initial Layout](/images/1/2.png)

Now, being a person with absolutely no artistic skill, this is the best I can come up with at the moment. Please forgive me üòÇ,

The next part is to upload the website to GitHub pages. Looking around the internet, I [found](https://v2.nuxt.com/deployments/github-pages/) that you can deploy Nuxt 2 website to Github Pages straightaway, however this only works in Nuxt and since the version I'm using is Nuxt 3, this is an issue.
So what should a good programmer do in this scenario? Check up the documentation for both Nuxt and GitHub Pages to find the answer? No, obviously üòÅ.
The first step a *good programmer* should do at this point is to scour StackOverflow and find someone with a similar problem, and lo and behold, I [found](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71537227/how-to-deploy-an-generate-a-static-site-on-nuxt-3) one pretty much straightaway.

Now, the guy on the StackOverflow link much said he solved the issue by using [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) npm library and change some file. 
Now I got curious and just preemptively opened the repository setting in case I need to change something later. But then, I found this.
![Action!](/images/1/3.png)

Great, apparently somebody already made a GitHub Action to deploy nuxt site to Pages, so I don't need to set up anything and everything should run straightaway, right? üôÑ

Well, let's find out. I run the Github Action, wait for it to finish, and then open the GitHub Pages and...
![Loh](/images/1/4.png)
None of my styling works! Granted it's not the best styling, but not like this please...

## First Issue
Looking around the code, I found that for some bizarre reason, Tailwind's styling isn't generated in HTML head, weird...
![No Styling](/images/1/5.png)

My first guess was I forgot to add some postcss setting, but looking around, everything seems fine. 
Now, the easy way to tackle this is just to load tailwind from CDN, I don't plan to make custom styles or such anyway *(Future praguzz here, this is a lie ü§£)*, but this doesn't solve the issue, this just sidesteps the problem.
My next guess is for some reason the GitHub Action script I used doesn't install Tailwind during deployment. So I checked the YAML file and found the problem.
![Problem](/images/1/6.png)

I assume that's a carryover from Nuxt 2 and somehow overwrites the HTML head, deleting that line solved the issue.
While that might sound easy, because of my inexperience with this kind of deployment issue, between googling and testing the solutions, It took at a good chunk of my lunchtime just to find the root cause.
![Please forgive the names](/images/1/7.png)

So, the result is here, this website is up. This also marks the first time I successfully deployed a website using CI/CD, the first time I create something using Nuxt, and he first time I'm writing this blog-thingüòÖ.
I plan to develop this website and write more in the future, depending on my availability and motivation. Hopefully, I can keep my motivation up in the future ü§£. 

If you're still here by this point, I greatly appreciate you reading this ramble from an underpaid engineer writing for fun.
Thank you for reading and hope you have a great day!
